- Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Custom CSS will be used where necessary to further refine and beautify details, while maintaining a unified color scheme and style.
- All images, including banners, icons, and backgrounds, will be generated using the MCP tool with English prompts, and will match the overall style of the logo and site.
